>> Python Visualization Documentation

  There are many visualisation libraries in python and i had pretty much to choose     in so I opted the following as they are widely used in today's world!!! 
      1.Matplotlib
      2. Seaborn
    Now coming to the first choosen one.

        >> 1. Matplotlib

        Matplotlib is a low-level, flexible 2D plotting library in Python. It allows the creation of static, animated, and interactive plots and is often used as the foundation for other             visualization libraries.

            Its Unique Features are
                Customisable
                Enables 3D plotting
                Animation Support
                Latex Formatting

            The "Installation" is pretty much easy we just have to note it down for a quick reference.
            "pip install matplotlib" and this is it..
            A few common plot types are here
                Line plot
                Bar Graph
                Histogram 
                Scatter plot
                Pie Chart
                Box plot

            while we have gone through the rough sketch of matplotlib and its plot types, this basic structure of matplotlib can clear mist in our brains.
            
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            # the importing section that we noted down.
            x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
            y = [10, 20, 25, 30]
            plt.plot(x, y)
            plt.title("Line Plot")
            plt.xlabel("X Axis")
            plt.ylabel("Y Axis")
            plt.show()

      >> 2. Seaborn

      Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and focuses on statistical data visualization. It provides beautiful default styles and easier ways to create complex plots.
      
          Its unique features Unique Features:
              Built-in themes and color palettes             
              Integration with Pandas DataFrames
              Includes statistical plots like box plots, violin plots, and heatmaps
      
As we now know what a matplotlib and seaborn is and so the common plotting types, let us now learn how the plotting in both libraries is done.
First comes the basic of all, that is

   >> i. Line plot

      using matplotlib:
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        x = [1, 2, 3]
        y = [10, 20, 15]
        plt.plot(x, y)
        plt.show()

      using seaborn:
        import seaborn as sns
        import pandas as pd
        df = pd.DataFrame({'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [10, 20, 15]})
        sns.lineplot(data=df, x='x', y='y')

   >> ii. Scatter plot
    
      using matplotlib:
        plt.scatter([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
        plt.show()
      
      using seaborn:
        sns.scatterplot(x='x', y='y', data=df)
  
   >> iii. Bar Graph
    
      using matplotlib:
        plt.bar(['A', 'B', 'C'], [10, 20, 15])
        plt.show()
    
      using seaborn:
        df = pd.DataFrame({'category': ['A', 'B', 'C'], 'value': [10, 20, 15]})
        sns.barplot(x='category', y='value', data=df)

   >> iv. Histogram
    
      using matplotlib:
        plt.hist([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4])
        plt.show()
      
      using seaborn:
        sns.histplot([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4], bins=4)

   >> v. Pie chart

      using matplotlib:
        plt.pie([30, 40, 30], labels=['A', 'B', 'C'], autopct='%1.1f%%')
        plt.show()

>> Comparision between Matplotlib and seaborn

          Matplotlib                         Seaborn
    more code, more manual setup         less code
    very detailed control                limited control
    Good for large datasets              slower on large datasets
    great with Numpy, Pandas             great with Pandas
    basic styles                         prettier styles

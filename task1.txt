>> Python Visualization Documentation

There are many visualisation libraries in python and i had pretty much to choose in so I opted the following as they are widely used in today's world!!! 
1.Matplotlib
2. Seaborn
Now coming to the first choosen one.

1. Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a low-level, flexible 2D plotting library in Python. It allows the creation of static, animated, and interactive plots and is often used as the foundation for other visualization libraries.
The "Installation" is pretty much easy we just have to note it down for a quick reference.
"pip install matplotlib" and this is it..
A few common plot types are here
  Line plot
  Bar Graph
  Histogram 
  Scatter plot
  Pie Chart
while we have gone through the rough sketch of matplotlib and its plot types, this basic structure of matplotlib can clear mist in our brains.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# the importing section that we noted down.
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30]
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Line Plot")
plt.xlabel("X Axis")
plt.ylabel("Y Axis")
plt.show()
